00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.400
This is a tutorial on how to use your D-Wallet.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.500
D-wallet is a decentralized unique wallet to the DeFi world. 

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.800
In this video, we will show you how 

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.000
to import tokens in your wallet. To 

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.100
view your wallet, go to the top right corner. Click 

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.000
on it. Now, click on 'account details'. You 

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.200
will see the QR code of your wallet. You can scan 

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.600
it, add it in a mail or send it even per chat and send 

10
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.900
to a person who wants to send crypto to you. Under the QR 

11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.100
code, you will see numbers. These numbers are your 

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.400
public key. If you click on the numbers, they will be copied

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.600
and you can send it to someone who wants to send you 

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.000
crypto. If you click on the 'View on Etherscan' menu 

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.500
item, you can view your wallet on etherscan.io and 

16
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.900
all the transactions in more information. To export 

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.100
your private key, click on the menu item and enter your password 

18
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.500
that you use to log into D-Wallet. Save 

19
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.700
this series of numbers safely. Attention!! Anyone 

20
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.900
with this number of the private key can access the wallet from anywhere 

21
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.300
and withdraw your assets. Next, 

22
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.100
I'll show you how to import tokens into your wallet. At 

23
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.600
the moment you only see Ethereum in your assets. Click 

24
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.000
assets to continue. Look at the bottom of the page. It 

25
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.400
says 'don't see your tokens?' It also says 'Import 

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.500
tokens' Click on it. In the Import Token 

27
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.600
search box, enter the name of the token. In this 

28
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.700
video, I choose USDT. Click on 

29
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.800
the token and then click next. Then, click import 

30
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.300
token. The Token is now visible and available in 

31
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.700
your asset overview. Another option is to import 

32
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.900
custom tokens. Here you can import 

33
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.200
a token if it is not shown or suggested on the Wallet. Go 

34
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.500
to Custom Token. One of the things you need to do is 

35
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.800
check the contract address of the token. By this 

36
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.400
time, we will use another platform to search for any custom coins. You 

37
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.800
can search in Etherscan.io or any other block explorers. 

38
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.900
Hit the search bar and look for 

39
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.200
your desired token or you can filter it out as 

40
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.300
coins or token, depending on what you were looking for. 

41
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.600
I choose for now EAX token or easy token.

42
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.000
token. You can see the details of that token including 

43
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.100
address and transactions. Copy the contact 

44
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.200
address of the coin but check if it's the correct coin and go 

45
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.300
back to 'copy the address'. Paste the contract 

46
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.700
address into the Token Contract Address bar. Then 

47
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.800
head to add custom token. You can check the name if it is 

48
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.400
the correct token or coin you are looking for before clicking import.

49
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.200
If you are convinced, then click 'import tokens' and 

50
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.400
you can now finally see the token in your account, ready to use!
